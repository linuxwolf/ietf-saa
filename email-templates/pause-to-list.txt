Hi all,

We would like the list to consider a pause in the discussion in this thread [1]. The sergeant-at-arms (SAA) team (described in more detail at [2]) think the discussion would benefit from some time to reflect on what has been posted to date before responding further.

Thanks,
[NAME] on behalf of the SAA team
