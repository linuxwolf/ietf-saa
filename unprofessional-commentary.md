# Unprofessional commentary

## Introduction

[RFC 3005] states that inappropriate postings to ietf@ietf.org include:

* Unsolicited bulk e-mail
* Discussion of subjects unrelated to IETF policy, meetings,
      activities, or technical concerns
* Unprofessional commentary, regardless of the general subject
* Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are not
      sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or IETF.
      
"Unprofessional commentary" is not further described in RFC 3005. In some ways, it is an unfortunate term because the IETF is not considered by all to be a professional organization, and norms concerning professionalism can vary widely based on culture and context. But it is the term we have for now. For ietf@ietf.org to be a more functional list, the term requires further description, which is what this document seeks to do.

Judgments about what is considered unprofessional commentary will necessarily always be subjective. The boundary between appropriate and inappropriate list conduct will never be a bright line. Human behavior and communication do not lend themselves to the same precision that protocol engineering does.

## Descriptions

The current sergeant-at-arms team considers the following types of language to be unprofessional commentary:

**Threats of violence**

This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) online for the purposes of intimidation. 

**Attacks**

Attacks can come in several forms. They include personally attacking people for their opinions, beliefs, or ideas rather than criticizing the opinions, beliefs, and ideas themselves. They include name-calling, insulting, demeaning, and belittling people. They include criticizing an idea in an insulting or excessively hostile manner. They include otherwise criticizing a person for the purpose of discrediting the idea.

**Derogatory language**

This includes hurtful language related to the race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, marital status, religion, ethnicity, national origin, or ancestry of others.

## Operating procedures

See the [Standard Operating Procedures] to understand how the sergeant-at-arms team handles unprofessional commentary and other inappropriate postings.

## Disruptive Behavior

In some cases a particular post in itself may not be unprofessional commentary but may be part of a pattern of postings that are disruptive to the consensus-driven process (see [RFC 3934] and the [IESG Statement on Disruptive Posting]). The sergeant-at-arms team would consider this as inappropriate and follow the escalation ladder for handling postings containing unprofessional commentary as per [Standard Operating Procedures].
